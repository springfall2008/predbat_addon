* Click out of the repository list and refresh the page
* Scroll down and find Predbat, click on it and click 'Install'
* Once installed you can click start, it will now download the latest Predbat and start it running
* Predbat will error out as you have a Template configuration
* Navigate to '/addon_configs/6adb4f0d_predbat' directory in Home Assistant file editor or via a Samba/SSH mount
* Edit/replace the apps.yaml with the correct completed one as per Predbat documentation
* Click restart on the add-on if need be (it might start automatically anyhow)

Please note the predbat.log will be in this addon_configs directory also.

Do not run this at the same time as the appdaemon-predbat or Predbat within AppDaemon (stop them first and remember to only have one on auto-start)

## Installation outside Home Assistant

Predbat can be run on a seperate machine also, you will need a MacOS with Python3, a Linux box (e.g. Debian) or Windows with the Linux subsystem (not yet tested but should work).

* Download the files from rootfs directory (https://github.com/springfall2008/predbat_addon/tree/main/predbat/rootfs) into their own directory on your machine
* Make sure your python environment has the dependancies required installed (https://github.com/springfall2008/predbat_addon/blob/main/predbat/requirements.txt)
* Launch run.csh (you might want to make this startup from boot if you want to keep Predbat running). This will download Predbat for the first time and then fail.
* Edit apps.yaml (or copy your previous version from an old installs inside HA) as per the Predbat documentation
* Add ha_url / ha_key settings into apps.yaml.
  * The ha_url must be your Home Assistant machine e.g. http://homeassistant.local:8123
  * The ha_key must be the persistant key you can generate in Home Assistant in your user/security section
* Kill and re-start run.csh and it should run as normal. If you get errors about missing Python packages then install them.
